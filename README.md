## 🚀 About Me

I am a passionate CSE student with a strong foundation in **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. My journey began with a deep curiosity about AI-driven solutions, leading me to master **Python**, **NumPy**, **pandas**, **seaborn**, and core ML concepts.

I have hands-on experience working on projects like a **Book Recommendation System** and an advanced **Number Plate Detection System** that uses OpenCV and PaddleOCR. These projects have sharpened my skills in **data preprocessing**, **model training**, **evaluation**, and **real-time computer vision applications**.

Currently, I am expanding my expertise in **Generative AI**, exploring tools and frameworks such as **OpenAI API**, **LangChain**, and **LlamaIndex**, to build intelligent, conversational, and context-aware AI systems.

I'm also a dedicated **problem solver**, actively improving my skills through platforms like Codeforces and HackerRank by solving data structure and algorithm challenges.

## 📘 I'm a Problem Solver & Continuous Learner

I believe that problem solving builds a strong foundation for real-world software development. I'm consistently working on competitive programming and data structures to sharpen my logic and efficiency.

- 💻 [**Basic Data Structures Repository**](https://github.com/sbshihab24/Basic-Data-Structures)  
  This repository contains my C++ implementations of fundamental data structures.  
  I use it to **learn**, **practice**, and **solve problems** using arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and more.

- 🧠 I actively solve problems on platforms like:
  - [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/SbShihab)
  - [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/sbshihab2000)
